# Rice_Leaf_Disease_Detection
A classification model based on deep learning which categorize the diseases commonly found in rice leaf using captured images of leaf. We are using CNN to process the image data.

Dataset used from kaggle dataset.
the source code files are ipynb files, runs on jupyter notebook.
for gui tkinter is used.
for detection of non-leaf objects coco resnet model is used.

download the coco object detection model from :- https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5

trained model is also uploaded.
